# What is this

This is a simple scenario to learn the basics of Jolie and microservice programming. In the initial example provided in this repo, we stick to the basic features of Jolie, i.e., no sessions (correlation sets) nor architectural composition.

# Before you start

### Subscribe

1. Start [Watching](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/) this repository.
2. Feel free to use the comment features on all pull requests and commits you see, to ask questions ("Why did you do that?"), give feedback ("I don't think that does what you want" or "Nice!"), or give answers ("You have to use global variables for that. See this link for an amazing explanation of what you need.").

### Installation

Install the [Jolie programming language](http://www.jolie-lang.org/).

### Try to run the program

1. Start `chat.ol` first (the chat service), by running `jolie chat.ol` in a terminal.
2. Try some commands in `client.ol`. Run `jolie client.ol --help` for a list of commands.

# Exercise 1

1. Clone this repository, or fork it in your user account.
2. Have a look at [the rubric for the evaluation of microservices](https://github.com/microservices-course/material/blob/master/rubrics/design.md).
3. Try to assign scores to the implementation of the chat service.

# Exercise 2

1. Fork this repository in your user account.
2. Have a look at [the rubric for the evaluation of microservices](https://github.com/microservices-course/material/blob/master/rubrics/design.md).
3. Try to improve the code with respect to some aspect described in the rubric. Your improvement does not need to be complete! If it is complicated, just make a sketch; we will then discuss it at the next lecture. Commit the changes to your own git repository (the "fork").
4. Issue a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to discuss your changes.

# Exercise 3

1. Think of a cool feature that you would like the chat service to support.
2. Implement it!
3. Submit a pull request to get it included.
